# Escape

Escape is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace business model for renting vehicles. In this model, car owners, referred to as Hosts, will have the ability to list their vehicles on my platform, while renters (users) can browse, select, and book these vehicles for temporary use. This application will serve as an intermediary, facilitating seamless communication and transactions between Hosts and renters. It will offer features like secure payments, real-time availability, insurance options, and user reviews to build trust. The goal is to provide a convenient, affordable, and efficient vehicle rental experience for both parties while generating revenue through commission fees, service charges, and potential partnerships with insurance providers.
